# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis

The analysis of this data was to determine if the Thomas High School 9th grade math and reading scores were altered resulting in academic
dishonesty.  In order to check state-testing standards, the scores will need to be removed form the data set and the analysis will need 
to be ran and compared to the unalterd data set.   


## Results

Below are the DataFrames from the District_Summary and the District_Summary_Test.  When the test results for the Thomas High School 9th graders
was removed and replaced with NaN "Not-a-Number" value and then removed from the District_Summary, the results were not a significante change.
The average math score only dropped by 1% and the average reading score went down .1%.  The overall passing only dropped by .3%.
