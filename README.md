# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis

The analysis of this data was to determine if the Thomas High School 9th grade math and reading scores were altered resulting in academic
dishonesty.  In order to check state-testing standards, the scores will need to be removed form the data set and the analysis will need 
to be ran and compared to the unalterd data set.
